%@  This library module provides commonly used sample and population statistics functions.
%@  In this module, a @var{Sample} is simply a proper list of numbers, normally floating-point;
%@  @var{Weight} is a proper list of numbers and should be of the same length as @var{Sample}.
%@  
%@  @strong{Please note:} These functions are plain textbook algorithms and we make no claims
%@  about numerical stability, avoiding loss of precision, etc.
