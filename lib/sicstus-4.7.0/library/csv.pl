%@  This library module provides some utilities for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files and strings.
%@  In this context, a file is a sequence of @emph{records}, and a record is a sequence of @emph{fields}.
%@  In a CSV file, fields are separated by commas, and each record is terminated by @key{RET}.
%@
%@  This module does not report any syntax errors.  In the event of prematurely terminated input file,
%@  the current field and record will be terminated silently.
%@  
%@  Then a CSV record is read, it will yield a list of fields of the following form:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @item integer(@var{Number},@var{Codes})
%@  Stands for the integer @var{Number}, where @code{number_codes(@var{Number},@var{Codes})} holds,
%@  and @var{Codes} is the list of character codes actually read.
%@  
%@  @item float(@var{Number},@var{Codes})
%@  Stands for the float @var{Number}, where @code{number_codes(@var{Number},@var{Codes})} holds,
%@  and @var{Codes} is the list of character codes actually read.
%@  
%@  @item string(@var{Codes})
%@  Stands for the text string (list of character codes) @var{Codes}, and @code{number_codes(@var{Number},@var{Codes})}
%@  does not hold.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  When a CSV records is written, the @var{Codes} argument of the above terms is used, but
%@  the following fields are also allowed:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @item integer(@var{Number})
%@  Stands for the integer @var{Number}.
%@  
%@  @item float(@var{Number})
%@  Stands for the float @var{Number}.
%@  
%@  @item atom(@var{Atom})
%@  Stands for the atom @var{Atom}.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  Adapted to the conventions of this manual, RFC 4180 specifies the following.  Where this module relaxes
%@  the requirements, that is explicitly mentioned:
%@  
%@  @enumerate
%@  @item
%@  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line
%@  break. For example:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  aaa,bbb,ccc @key{RET}
%@  zzz,yyy,xxx @key{RET}
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  @item
%@  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line
%@  break. For example:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  aaa,bbb,ccc @key{RET}
%@  zzz,yyy,xxx
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  @item
%@  There may be an optional header line appearing as the first line
%@  of the file with the same format as normal record lines. This
%@  header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
%@  and should contain the same number of fields as the records in
%@  the rest of the file. For example:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  field_name,field_name,field_name @key{RET}
%@  aaa,bbb,ccc @key{RET}
%@  zzz,yyy,xxx @key{RET}
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  This module does not attempt to detect a header line nor
%@  treat it in any special way.
%@  
%@  @item
%@  Within the header and each record, there may be one or more
%@  fields, separated by commas. Each record should contain the same
%@  number of fields throughout the file. Spaces are considered part
%@  of a field and should not be ignored. The last field in the
%@  record must not be followed by a comma, so if the record ends with a
%@  comma, the last field is treated as empty.  For example, the following
%@  is treated as four fields:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  aaa,bbb,ccc,
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  This module does not require or check that each record contains
%@  the same number of fields.
%@  
%@  @item
%@  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes.
%@  If fields contain line breaks (@key{RET}), double quotes or commas,
%@  then they should be enclosed in double quotes, otherwise the double quotes may be omitted.
%@  For example:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  "aaa","bbb","ccc" @key{RET}
%@  "aaa","b @key{RET}
%@  bb","ccc" @key{RET}
%@  zzz,yyy,xxx
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  If an unenclosed field is immediately followed by a @kbd{"}, (or vice versa), then this module
%@  treats that as a new enclosed (or unenclosed) field to be read and appended to the field read so far.
%@  
%@  @item
%@  If double quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double quote
%@  appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
%@  another double quote. For example:
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  "aaa","b""bb","ccc"
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  @end enumerate
