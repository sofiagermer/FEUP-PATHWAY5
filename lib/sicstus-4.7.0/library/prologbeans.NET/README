This is a translation of the Java version of PrologBeans into C# and
.NET 4.0. It can be used without the J# libraries that Microsof has
discontinued.

It is a, partially automated, literal translation of the corresponding
Java code (with extensive manual cleanup). This means that it most
likely does not represent "good" C# practice. Instead the focus has
been on binary compatibility with the J# version, with some minor
C#-isms added.

To ensure binary (and assembly-manifest) compatibility the DLL must be
called prologbeans.dll, so it can not coexist with the J#-version in
the same folder.

You can build it yourself by passing all the .cs files to csc.exe, e.g. (all on one line):

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /warn:4 /warnaserror+ /target:library /reference:System.Numerics.dll /out:prologbeans.dll /doc:prologbeans.NET.xml PBBignum.cs PBMonitor.cs PBInteger.cs PBCompound.cs Bindings.cs PBAtomic.cs QueryAnswer.cs PBFloat.cs PBListCell.cs PBNil.cs PrologSession.cs FastWriter.cs PBVariable.cs PBAtom.cs FastParser.cs PBTerm.cs

You may want to pass additional flags, e.g. for optimization and debug
information, to the csc.exe compiler.

The code also works with Mono, e.g. on OS X.

The license is the same as for the PrologBeans Java code.
