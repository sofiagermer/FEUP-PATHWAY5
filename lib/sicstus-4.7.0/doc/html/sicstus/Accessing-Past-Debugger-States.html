<h4 class="subsection">5.6.8 Accessing Past Debugger States</h4>

<p>In this section we introduce the built-in predicates for accessing
past debugger states, and the breakpoint conditions related to
these.
</p>
<a name="index-backtrace-1"></a>
<p>The debugger collects control flow information about the goals
being executed, more precisely about those goals, for which a
procedure box is built.  This collection of information, the
backtrace, includes the invocations that were called but not
exited yet, as well as those that exited nondeterminately. For
each invocation, the main data items present in the backtrace are
the following: the goal, the module, the invocation number,
the depth and the source information, if any.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you can enter a new break level from within the
debugger, there can be multiple backtraces, one for each active
break level.
</p>

<a name="index-execution_005fstate_002f_005b1_002c2_005d-_0028built_002din_0029-4"></a>
<a name="index-execution_005fstate_002f_005b1_002c2_005d-_0028built_002din_0029-1"></a>

<p>You can access all the information collected by the debugger using the
built-in predicate <code>execution_state(<var>Focus</var>,
<var>Tests</var>)</code>.  Here <var>Focus</var> is a ground term specifying
which break level and which invocation to access.  It can be one of the
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>break_level(<var>BL</var>)</code> selects the <em>current</em> invocation
within the break level <var>BL</var>.
</li><li> <code>inv(<var>Inv</var>)</code> selects the invocation number <var>Inv</var> within the
current break level.
</li><li> A list containing the above two elements, selects the invocation
with number <var>Inv</var> within break level <var>BL</var>.
</li></ul>

<p>Note that the top level counts as break level 0, while the invocations
are numbered from 1 upwards.
</p>
<p>The second argument of <code>execution_state/2</code>, <var>Tests</var>, is a
simple or composite breakpoint condition. Most simple tests can
appear inside <var>Tests</var>, with the exception of the <code>port</code>,
<code>bid</code>, <code>advice</code>, <code>debugger</code>, and <code>get</code> tests.  These
tests will be interpreted in the context of the specified past debugger
state. Specifically, if a <code>true/1</code> condition is used, then any
<code>execution_state/1</code> queries appearing in it will be evaluated in
the past context.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the use of <code>execution_state/2</code>, we now define a
predicate <code>last_call_arg(ArgNo, Arg)</code>, which is to be called
from within a break, and which will look at the last debugged goal
of the previous break level, and return in <code>Arg</code> the <code>ArgNo</code>th
argument of this goal.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">last_call_arg(ArgNo, Arg) :-
        execution_state(break_level(BL1)),
        BL is BL1-1,                         
        execution_state(break_level(BL), goal(Goal)),
        arg(ArgNo, Goal, Arg).
</pre></div>

<p>We see two occurrences of the term <code>break_level(&hellip;)</code> in
the above example. Although these look very similar, they have different
roles. The first one, in <code>execution_state/1</code>, is a breakpoint
test, which unifies the current break level with its
argument.  Here it is used to obtain the current break level and
store it in <code>BL1</code>.  The second use of <code>break_level(&hellip;)</code>,
in the first argument of <code>execution_state/2</code>, is a focus
condition, whose argument has to be instantiated, and which
prescribes the break level to focus on. Here we use it to obtain the
goal of the current invocation of the previous break level.
</p>
<p>Note that the goal retrieved from the backtrace is always in
its latest instantiation state.  For example, it is not possible to
get hold of the goal instantiation at the Call port,
if the invocation in question is at the Exit port.
</p>
<p>Here is an example run, showing how <code>last_call_arg/2</code> can be used:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">        5      2 Call: _937 is 13+8 ? <kbd>b</kbd>
% Break level 1
% 1
| ?- <kbd>last_call_arg(2, A).</kbd>
A = 13+8
</pre></div>

<p>There are some further breakpoint tests that are primarily used in
looking at past execution states.
</p>
<a name="index-max_005finv_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<a name="index-exited_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<p>The test <code>max_inv(<var>MaxInv</var>)</code> returns the maximal invocation
number within the current (or selected) break level. The test
<code>exited(<var>Boolean</var>)</code> unifies <var>Boolean</var> with
<code>true</code> if the invocation has exited, and with <code>false</code>
otherwise.
</p>
<p>The following example predicate lists those goals in the
backtrace, together with their invocation numbers, that have
exited. These are the invocations that are listed by the <kbd>t</kbd>
interactive debugger command (print backtrace), but not by the <kbd>g</kbd>
command (print ancestor goals). Note that the predicate
<code>between(<em>N,M,I</em>)</code> enumerates all integers such that <em>N
\leq I \leq M</em>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">exited_goals :-
     execution_state(max_inv(Max)), 
     between(1, Max, Inv),
     execution_state(inv(Inv), [exited(true),goal(G)]),
     format('~t~d~6| ~p\n', [Inv,G]),
     fail.
exited_goals.
(&hellip;)

?*     41     11 Exit: foo(2,1) ? <kbd>@</kbd>
| :- exited_goals.
    26 foo(3,2)
    28 bar(3,1,1)
    31 foo(2,1)
    33 bar(2,1,0)
    36 foo(1,1)
    37 foo(0,0)
    39 foo(1,1)
    41 foo(2,1)
    43 bar(2,1,0)
    46 foo(1,1)
    47 foo(0,0)
?*     41     11 Exit: foo(2,1) ? 
</pre></div>

<p>Note that similar output can be obtained by entering a new break level
and calling <code>exited_goals</code> from within an <code>execution_state/2</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">% 1
| ?- <kbd>execution_state(break_level(0), true(exited_goals)).</kbd>
</pre></div>

<a name="index-ancestor_002f2-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<a name="index-parent_005finv_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<p>The remaining two breakpoint tests allow you to find parent
and ancestor invocations in the backtrace. The
<code>parent_inv(<var>Inv</var>)</code> test unifies <var>Inv</var> with the
invocation number of the youngest ancestor present in the
backtrace, called <em>debugger-parent</em> for short. The test
<code>ancestor(<var>AncGoal</var>,<var>Inv</var>)</code> looks for the youngest
ancestor in the backtrace that is an instance of
<var>AncGoal</var>. It then unifies the ancestor goal with
<var>AncGoal</var> and its invocation number with <var>Inv</var>.
</p>
<p>Assume you would like to stop at all invocations of <code>foo/2</code> that
are somewhere within <code>bar/1</code>, possibly deeply nested. The following
two breakpoints achieve this effect:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>spy(bar/1, advice), spy(foo/2, ancestor(bar(_),_)).</kbd>
% Plain advice point for user:bar/1 added, BID=3
% Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=4
</pre></div>

<p>We added an advice point for <code>bar/1</code> to ensure that all calls
to it will have procedure boxes built, and so become part of the
backtrace.  advice points are a better choice than
spypoints for this purpose, as with <code>?- spy(bar/1, -proceed)</code>
the debugger will not stop at the call port of <code>bar/1</code> in
trace mode. Note that it is perfectly all right to create an
advice point using <code>spy/2</code>, although this is a bit of
terminological inconsistency.
