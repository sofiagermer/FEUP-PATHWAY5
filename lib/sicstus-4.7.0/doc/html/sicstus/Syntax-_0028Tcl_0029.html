<h4 class="subsubsection">10.45.2.1 Syntax</h4>

<p>A Tcl script consists of a series of strings separated from each other
by a newline character. Each string contains a command or series of
semi-colon separated commands.  A command is a series of words separated
by spaces. The first word in a command is the name of the command and
subsequent words are its arguments.
</p>
<p>An example is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set a 1
set b 2
</pre></div>

<p>which is a Tcl script of two commands: the first command sets the value
of variable <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, and the second command sets the value
of variable <code>b</code> to <code>2</code>.
</p>
<p>An example of two commands on the same line separated by a semi-colon
is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set a 1; set b 2
</pre></div>

<p>which is equivalent to the previous example but written entirely on one
line.
</p>
<p>A command is executed in two phases.  In the first phase, the command is
broken down into its constituent words and various textual substitutions
are performed on those words.  In the second phase, the procedure to
call is identified from the first word in the command, and the procedure
is called with the remaining words as arguments.
</p>
<p>There are special syntactic characters that control how the first
phase, the substitution phase, is carried out. The three major
substitution types are variable substitution, command substitution, and
backslash substitution.
</p>
<p><em>Variable substitution</em> happens when a &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; prefixed word is found
in a command.  There are three types of variable substitution:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <code>$<var>name</var></code>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- where <var>name</var> is a scalar variable. <var>name</var> is simply substituted
in the word for its value. <var>name</var> can contain only letters, 
digits, or underscores.
</li></ul>

</li><li>- <code>$<var>name</var>(<var>index</var>)</code>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- where <var>name</var> is the name of an array variable and <var>index</var> is the
index into it. This is substituted by the value of the array element.
<var>name</var> must contain only letters, digits, or underscores.
<var>index</var> has variable, command, and backslash substitution performed
on it too.
</li></ul>

</li><li>- <code>${<var>name</var>}</code>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- where <var>name</var> can have any characters in it except closing curly
bracket.  This is more or less the same as <code>$<var>name</var></code>
substitution except it is used to get around the restrictions in the
characters that can form <var>name</var>.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>An example of variable substitution is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set a 1
set b $a
</pre></div>

<p>which sets the value of variable <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, and then sets the value
of variable <code>b</code> to the value of variable <code>a</code>.
</p>
<p><em>Command substitution</em> happens when a word contains an open square bracket,
&lsquo;<samp>[</samp>&rsquo;. The string between the open bracket and matching closing bracket
are treated as a Tcl script. The script is evaluated and its result
is substituted in place of the original command substitution word.
</p>
<p>A simple example of command substitution is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set a 1
set b [set a]
</pre></div>

<p>which does the same as the previous example but using command
substitution.  The result of a <code>set a</code> command is to return the
value of <code>a</code>, which is then passed as an argument to
<code>set b</code> and so variable <code>b</code> acquires the value of variable
<code>a</code>.
</p>
<p><em>Backslash substitution</em> is performed whenever the interpreter comes
across a backslash.  The backslash is an escape character and when it is
encountered is causes the interpreter to handle the next characters
specially.  Commonly escaped characters are &lsquo;<samp>\a</samp>&rsquo; for audible bell,
&lsquo;<samp>\b</samp>&rsquo; for backspace, &lsquo;<samp>\f</samp>&rsquo; for form feed, &lsquo;<samp>\n</samp>&rsquo; for newline,
&lsquo;<samp>\r</samp>&rsquo; for carriage return, &lsquo;<samp>\t</samp>&rsquo; for horizontal tab, and
&lsquo;<samp>\v</samp>&rsquo; for vertical tab. Double-backslash, &lsquo;<samp>\\</samp>&rsquo;, is substituted
with a single backslash.  Other special backslash substitutions have the
following forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>\ooo</code>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- the digits <code>ooo</code> give the octal value of the escaped character
</li></ul>

</li><li> <code>\xHH</code>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- the <code>x</code> denotes that the following hexadecimal digits are the value
of the escaped character
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Any other character that is backslash escaped is simply substituted by
the character itself. For example, <code>\W</code> is replaced by <code>W</code>.
</p>
<p>A further syntactic construction is used to <em>delay substitution</em>.
When the beginning of a word starts with a curly bracket, &lsquo;<samp>{</samp>&rsquo;, it
does not do any of the above substitutions between the opening curly
bracket and its matching closing curly bracket.  The word ends with the
matching closing curly bracket.  This construct is used to make the
bodies of procedures in which substitutions happen when the procedure is
called, not when it is constructed.  Or it is used anywhere when the
programmer does not want the normal substitutions to happen. For
example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">puts {I have $20}
</pre></div>

<p>will print the string &lsquo;<samp>I have $20</samp>&rsquo; and will not try variable
substitution on the &lsquo;<samp>$20</samp>&rsquo; part.
</p>
<p>A word delineated by curly brackets is replaced with the characters
within the brackets without performing the usual substitutions.
</p>
<p>A word can begin with a <em>double-quote</em> and end with the matching closing
double-quote. Substitutions as detailed above are done on the
characters between the quotes, and the result is then substituted for
the original word. Typically double-quotes are used to group 
sequences of characters that contain spaces into a single command word.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set name &quot;Fred the Great&quot;
puts &quot;Hello my name is $name&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>outputs &lsquo;<samp>Hello my name is Fred the Great</samp>&rsquo;. The first command sets
the value of variable <code>name</code> to the following double-quoted string
<code>&quot;Fred the Great&quot;</code>. The the next command prints its argument,
a single argument because it is a word delineated by
double-quotes, that has had variable substitution performed on it.
</p>
<p>Here is the same example but using curly brackets instead of double-quotes:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set name {Fred the Great}
puts {Hello my name is $name}
</pre></div>

<p>gives the output &lsquo;<samp>Hello my name is $name</samp>&rsquo; because substitutions
are suppressed by the curly bracket notation.
</p>
<p>And again the same example but without either curly brackets or double-quotes:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">set name Fred the Great
puts Hello my name is $name
</pre></div>

<p>simply fails because both <code>set</code> and <code>puts</code> expect a single
argument but without the word grouping effects of double-quotes or
curly brackets they find that they have more than one argument and
throw an exception.
</p>
<p>Being a simple scripting language, Tcl does not have any real idea of
data types. The interpreter simply manipulates strings.  The Tcl
interpreter is not concerned with whether those strings contain
representations of numbers or names or lists.  It is up to the commands
themselves to interpret the strings that are passed to them as
arguments in any manner those choose.
