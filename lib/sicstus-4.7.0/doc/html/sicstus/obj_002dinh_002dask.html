<h4 class="subsubsection">10.29.3.3 Asking About Classes and Objects</h4>

<p>It is possible to determine, at run time, what classes are defined,
how they are related by inheritance, what class an object belongs to,
etc. This section describes the predicates used for those
purposes. Most of the predicates involve the class hierarchy, so they
are properly described in the section on inheritance. But, several can
be useful even in programs that use only simple classes.
</p>
<p>Most of these predicates come in pairs, where one predicate involves
one class or its direct superclasses, and the other predicate involves
all ancestors. For example, the <code>class_superclass/2</code> and
<code>class_ancestor/2</code> predicates connect a currently defined class to
its superclass(es) and to all its ancestors, respectively.
</p>
<p>In all of these predicates, the ancestors of a class include not only
superclasses and their ancestors, but also the class itself. A class
cannot be a superclass of itself, by the rules of defining
classes. However, it is convenient to consider every class an ancestor
of itself, because then we may say that every property of a class is
defined in one of its ancestors, without having to say &ldquo;the class
itself or a superclass or a superclass of a superclass, etc.&rdquo;
</p>

<a name="Objects"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Objects</h4>


<p>The <code>class_of/2</code> predicate is used to test whether an object is of a
particular type or to determine the type of an object. Similarly, the
<code>descendant_of/2</code> predicate relates an object to all ancestors of its
class. (Remember that the object&rsquo;s class is, itself, an ancestor class
of the object.)
</p>
<p>Both require the first argument (the object) to be instantiated. That
is, the predicates cannot be used to find objects of a given class. If
you need to search among all the objects of a class, then you must provide
a way to do it. One way to do this is to assert a fact connecting the
class name to every object, when it is created. The named_point
example of the previous section took that idea a step further by
allowing each object to have a different name.
</p>
<p>The <code>pointer_object/2</code> predicate relates an object&rsquo;s address (a pointer)
to the object. Remember that an instance of <var>Class</var> is represented by a
term of the form
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>Class</var>(<var>Address</var>)
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>pointer_object/2</code> predicate requires that one of its arguments be
instantiated, but it may be either one. Hence, just by knowing the
address of an object (which possibly was returned by a foreign
function) it is possible to determine the object&rsquo;s type.
</p>
<p>Most Prolog programmers can safely ignore the <code>pointer_object/2</code>
predicate, unless they are using SICStus Objects with foreign
functions or with the Structs package.  
</p>
<a name="Classes"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Classes</h4>


<p>The <code>current_class/1</code> predicate is used to ask whether a class is 
currently defined or to get the names of all currently defined 
classes.
</p>
<p>The <code>class_superclass/2</code> predicate is used to test whether one class
is a superclass of another, or to find a class&rsquo;s superclasses, or to
find a class&rsquo;s subclasses, or to find all subclass-superclass pairs.
The <code>class_ancestor/2</code> predicate is used in the same ways for the
ancestor relation between currently defined classes.
</p>
<p>As an example, the following goal finds all the ancestors of each
currently defined class.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>setof(C-As,
	   (current_class(C),
	    setof(A, class_ancestor(C,A), As)),
	   L).</kbd>
</pre></div>


<p>It binds <code>L</code> to a list of terms of the form
<var>Class</var>-<var>AncestorList</var>, with one term for each currently defined
class.
</p>
<p>Arguably, this predicate violates the principle of information hiding,
by letting you ask about how a class is defined.  Therefore, you
should generally avoid it.  It may be useful, however, in debugging
and in building programmer support tools.
</p>


<a name="Messages"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Messages</h4>


<p>The <code>message/4</code> predicate is used to ask whether a message is
defined for a class or to find what messages are defined for a class,
etc. It does not distinguish between messages whose methods are
defined in the class itself and those that are inherited from a
superclass.
</p>
<p>The <code>direct_message/4</code> predicate is used to ask whether a message is
not only defined for a class, but whether the method for that message
is defined in the class itself. It can also be used to determine
which methods are defined in a class. This ability to look inside a
class definition makes <code>direct_message/4</code> an egregious violator of
the principle of information hiding.  Thus it, like
<code>class_ancestor/2</code>, should mainly be confined to use in programmer
support applications.
</p>
<p>Both <code>message/4</code> and <code>direct_message/4</code> take the message operator
as an argument, along with the class, message name and arity. Hence it
is possible to use these predicates to ask about get, put or send
messages.
</p>
<p>It is not possible to ask about a class&rsquo;s slots, nor should it
be. However, it is possible (and quite reasonable) to ask about the
get and put messages that are defined for a class. For example, the
following goal finds all the 1-argument messages that are defined for
both the get and put message operators in the class <var>Class</var>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>setof(Message,
	   (message(<var>Class</var>, &lt;&lt;, Msg, 1), 
	    message(<var>Class</var>, &gt;&gt;, Msg, 1)), 
	   L).</kbd>
</pre></div>


<p>There may or may not be slots corresponding to these messages; that
detail is hidden in the definition of <var>Class</var>. However, it should be
possible to use <var>Class</var> as if the slots were there.
</p>
<p>As an example, recall the polar coordinate interface to the point
class, which defined get and put methods for <code>r</code> and <code>theta</code>, even
though data was represented inside an object by rectangular
coordinates <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
