<h4 class="subsection">5.6.6 Advice points</h4>

<a name="index-advice-breakpoint-1"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint_002c-advice-1"></a>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are two kinds of breakpoints:
spypoints and advice points.  The main purpose of
spypoints is to support interactive debugging. In contrast with
this, advice points can help you to perform non-interactive
debugging activities. For example, the following advice point will
check a program invariant: whether the condition <code>Y-X&lt;3</code>
always holds at exit from <code>foo(X,Y)</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>add_breakpoint([pred(foo/2),advice] </kbd>
                    <kbd>-[exit,goal(foo(X,Y)),\+true(Y-X&lt;3),trace], _).</kbd>
% Conditional advice point for user:foo/2 added, BID=1
% advice
| ?- <kbd>foo(4, Y).</kbd>
Y = 3
% advice
| ?- <kbd>foo(9, Y).</kbd>
        3      3 Exit: foo(7,13) ? <kbd>n</kbd>
        2      2 Exit: foo(8,21) ? 
</pre></div>

<a name="index-advice_002f0-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<a name="index-debugger_002f0-_0028debugger-condition_0029"></a>
<p>The test part of the above breakpoint contains a <code>pred</code> test,
and the <code>advice</code> condition, making it an advice point.  (You
can also include the <code>debugger</code> condition in spypoint specs,
although this is the default interpretation.)
</p>
<p>The action part starts with the <code>exit</code> port
condition. Because of this the rest of the action part is evaluated only
at Exit ports. By placing the port condition in the action
part, we ensure the creation of a procedure box at the Call
port, as explained earlier.
</p>
<p>Next, we get hold of the goal arguments using the
<code>goal</code> condition, and use the <code>\+true(Y-X&lt;3)</code> test to check if
the invariant is violated. If this happens, then the last condition sets the
<code>mode</code> action variable to <code>trace</code>, switching on the
interactive debugger.
</p>
<p>Following the <code>add_breakpoint/2</code> call the above example shows two
top-level calls to <code>foo/2</code>. The invariant holds within the first
goal, but is violated within the second. Notice that the advice
mechanism works with the interactive debugger switched off.
</p>
<p>You can ask the question, why do we need advice points? The same
task could be implemented using a spypoint. For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>add_breakpoint(pred(foo/2)</kbd>
                    <kbd>-[exit,goal(foo(X,Y)),\+true(Y-X&lt;3),leash], _).</kbd>
% The debugger will first zip -- showing spypoints (zip)
% Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=1
% zip
| ?- <kbd>foo(4, X).</kbd>
X = 3
% zip
| ?- <kbd>foo(9, X).</kbd>
 *      3      3 Exit: foo(7,13) ? <kbd>z</kbd>
 *      2      2 Exit: foo(8,21) ? 
</pre></div>

<p>The main reason to have a separate advice mechanism is to be able to
perform checks independently of the interactive debugging. With the
second solution, if you happen to start some interactive debugging, then you
cannot be sure that the invariant is always checked. For example, no
spypoints will be activated during a skip. In contrast with this,
the advice mechanism is watching the program execution all the
time, independently of the debugging mode.
</p>
<p>Advice points are handled in very much the same way as
spypoints are.  When arriving at a port, advice point
selection takes place first, followed by spypoint selection. This
can be viewed as the debugger making two passes over the current
breakpoints, considering advice points only in the first
pass, and spypoints only in the second.
</p>
<p>In both passes the debugger tries to find a breakpoint that can be
activated, checking the test and action parts, as described earlier.
However, there are some differences between the two passes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Advice processing is performed if there are any (non-disabled)
advice points. Spypoint processing is only done if the
debugger is switched on, and is not doing a skip.
</li><li> For advice points, the action variables are initialized as follows:
<code>mode</code> is set to current debugging mode, <code>command = proceed</code>,
<code>show = silent</code>. Note that this is done independently of the
debugging mode (in contrast with the spypoint search initialization).
</li><li> The default action part for advice points is <code>[]</code>. This means that
if no action part is given, then the only effect of the advice point
will be to build a procedure box (because of the <code>command = proceed</code>
initialization).
</li><li> If no advice point was found applicable, then <code>command</code> is set to
<code>flit</code>. 
</li></ul>

<p>Having performed advice processing, the debugger inspects the
<code>command</code> variable. The command values different from
<code>proceed</code> and <code>flit</code> are called <em>divertive</em>, as they alter
the normal flow of control (e.g. <code>proceed(&hellip;,&hellip;)</code>), or
involve user interaction (<code>ask</code>). If the <code>command</code> value is
divertive, then the prescribed action is performed immediately, without
executing the spypoint selection process. Otherwise, if
<code>command = proceed</code>, then it is noted that the advice part requests the
building of a procedure box.  Next, the second, spypoint
processing pass is carried out, and possible user interaction takes
place, as described earlier. A procedure box is built if either
the advice point or the spypoint search requests this.
</p>
<p>Let us conclude this section by another example, a generic
advice point for collecting branch coverage information:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>add_breakpoint(</kbd>
      <kbd>(advice,call) -</kbd>
          <kbd>(   line(F,L) -&gt; true(assert(line_reached(F,L))), flit</kbd>
          <kbd>;   flit</kbd>
          <kbd>), _).</kbd>
% Generic advice point added, BID=1
% advice,source_info
| ?- <kbd>foo(4,X).</kbd>
X = 3 ? <kbd>;</kbd>
no
% advice,source_info
| ?- <kbd>setof(X, line_reached(F,X), S).</kbd>
F = '/home/bob/myprog.pl',
S = [31,33,34,35,36]
</pre></div>

<p>This advice point will be applicable at every Call port. It
will then assert a fact with the file name and the line number if
source information is available. Finally, it will set the <code>command</code>
variable to <code>flit</code> on both branches of execution. This is to
communicate the fact that the advice point does not request the
building of a procedure box.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that this recording of the line numbers reached
is performed independently of the interactive debugging.
</p>
<p>In this example we used the <code>','/2</code> operator, rather than
list notation, for describing the conjunction of conditions, as
this seems to better fit the if-then-else expression used in the action
part. We could have still used lists in the tests part, and in the
&ldquo;then&rdquo; part of the actions. Note that if we omit the &ldquo;else&rdquo; branch, then
the action part will fail if no source information is available for the
given call.  This will cause a procedure box to be built, which is
an unnecessary overhead. An alternative solution, using the
<code>line/2</code> test twice, is the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>add_breakpoint([advice,call,line(_,_)]-</kbd>
                    <kbd>[line(F,L),true(assert(line_reached(F,L))),flit], _).</kbd>
</pre></div>

<code>library(debugger_examples)</code>.
