<p>The semantics of definite clauses should be fairly clear from the
informal  interpretations already given.  However, it is useful to have
a precise definition.  The <em>declarative semantics</em> of  definite  clauses
tells  us  which  goals  can  be  considered true according to a given
program, and is defined recursively as follows:
</p>
<a name="index-clause_002c-instance-of"></a>
<a name="index-instance-of-clause"></a>


<blockquote>

<p>A goal is <em>true</em> if it is the head of some clause instance and
     each  of  the  goals  (if  any)  in  the body of that clause
     instance is true, where an <em>instance</em>
     of a clause (or term) is
     obtained  by  substituting,  for each of zero or more of its
     variables, a new term for all occurrences of the variable.
</p></blockquote>


<p>For example, if a program contains the procedure for <code>concatenate/3</code>,
declared in <a href="ref_002dsem_002dpro.html#ref_002dsem_002dpro">ref-sem-pro</a>, then the declarative semantics tells us that
(A) is true, because this goal is the head of a certain instance of
the second clause (K) for <code>concatenate/3</code>, namely (B), and we
know that the only goal in the body of this clause instance is true,
because it is an instance of the unit clause that is the first clause
for <code>concatenate/3</code>.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">concatenate([a], [b], [a,b])
</pre></div>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">concatenate([a], [b], [a,b]):-
   concatenate([], [b], [b]).
</pre></div>


<a name="index-procedural-semantics-1"></a>
<a name="index-semantics_002c-procedural-1"></a>

<p>Note that the declarative semantics makes  no  reference  to  the
sequencing of goals within the body of a clause, nor to the sequencing
of clauses within a program.  This sequencing information is, however,
very  relevant  for  the  <em>procedural semantics</em> that Prolog gives to
definite clauses.  The procedural semantics defines  exactly  how  the
Prolog  system  will execute a goal, and the sequencing information is
the means by which the Prolog programmer directs the system to execute
his  program  in a sensible way.  The effect of executing a goal is to
enumerate, one by one, its true instances.  Here is  an  informal
definition of the procedural semantics.
</p>
<a name="index-backtracking"></a>

<a name="index-unification"></a>


<blockquote>

<p>To <em>execute</em> a goal, the system searches forwards from the
beginning of the program for the first clause whose head <em>matches</em>
or <em>unifies</em> with the goal.  The <em>unification</em> process
[Robinson 65] finds the most general common instance of the two terms,
which is unique if it exists.  If a match is found, then the matching
clause instance is then <em>activated</em> by executing in turn, from
left to right, each of the goals (if any) in its body.  If at any time
the system fails to find a match for a goal, then it <em>backtracks</em>; that
is, it rejects the most recently activated clause, undoing any
substitutions made by the match with the head of the clause.  Next it
reconsiders the original goal that activated the rejected clause, and
tries to find a subsequent clause that also matches the goal.
</p></blockquote>


<p>For example, if we execute the goal expressed by the query (A), then we find
that it matches the head of the second clause for <code>concatenate/3</code>, with
<code>X</code> instantiated to <code>[a|X1]</code>. The new variable <code>X1</code> is constrained by the
new goal produced, which is the recursive procedure call (B) and this
goal matches the second clause, instantiating <code>X1</code> to <code>[b|X2]</code>, and
yielding the new goal (C).
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">| ?- <kbd>concatenate(X, Y, [a,b]).</kbd> <!-- /@w --> (A)
</pre></div>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">concatenate(X1, Y, [b]) <!-- /@w --> (B)
</pre></div>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">concatenate(X2, Y, []) <!-- /@w --> (C)
</pre></div>

<p>Now this goal will only match the first clause, instantiating both <code>X2</code>
and <code>Y</code> to <code>[]</code>. Since there are no further goals to be executed, we have
a solution
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">X = [a,b]
Y = []
</pre></div>

<p>That is, the following is a true instance of the original goal:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">concatenate([a,b], [], [a,b])
</pre></div>

<p>If this solution is rejected, then backtracking will generate  the  further
solutions
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">X = [a]
Y = [b]

X = []
Y = [a,b]
</pre></div>

<p>in  that  order,  by  re-matching goals already solved once using the first
clause of <code>concatenate/3</code>, against the second clause.
</p>

<p>Thus, in the procedural semantics, the set of clauses
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>H</var> :- <var>B1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Bm</var>.
<var>H'</var> :- <var>B1'</var>, &hellip;, <var>Bm'</var>.
&hellip;
</pre></div>

<p><a name="index-procedure-definition"></a>
<a name="index-definition_002c-procedure"></a>
are regarded as a <em>procedure definition</em> for some predicate
<var>H</var>, and in a query
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">?- <var>G1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gn</var>.
</pre></div>

<p><a name="index-procedure-call-1"></a>
<a name="index-call_002c-procedure-1"></a>
<a name="index-computation-rule"></a>
<a name="index-rule_002c-computation"></a>
<a name="index-search-rule"></a>
<a name="index-rule_002c-search"></a>
<a name="index-unification-1"></a>
<a name="index-most-general-unifier"></a>
<a name="index-unifier_002c-most-general"></a>
each <var>Gi</var> is regarded as a <em>procedure call</em>.  To execute a
query, the system selects by its <em>computation rule</em> a
goal, <var>Gj</var> say, and searches by its <em>search rule</em> a
clause whose head matches <var>Gj</var>.  Matching is done by the
<em>unification</em> algorithm (see [Robinson 65]), which computes the most
general unifier, <em>mgu</em>, of <var>Gj</var> and <var>H</var>).  The
<var>mgu</var> is unique if it exists.  If a match is found, then the current
query is <em>reduced</em> to a new query
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">?- (<var>G1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gj-1</var>, <var>B1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Bm</var>, <var>Gj+1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gn</var>)<var>mgu</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>and a new cycle is started.  The execution terminates when the empty
query has been produced.
</p>
<a name="index-backtracking-1"></a>
<p>If there is no matching head for a goal, then the execution
backtracks to the most recent successful match in an attempt to
find an alternative match.  If such a match is found, then an alternative new
query is produced, and a new cycle is started.
</p>
<p>In SICStus Prolog, as in other Prolog systems, the search rule is
simple: &ldquo;search forward from the beginning of the program&rdquo;.  
</p>
<p>The computation rule in traditional Prolog systems is also simple:
&ldquo;pick the leftmost goal of the current query&rdquo;.  However,
SICStus Prolog and other modern implementations have a somewhat more
complex computation rule &ldquo;pick the leftmost unblocked goal
of the current query&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>A goal can be blocked on one ore more uninstantiated
variables, and a variable may block several
goals.  Thus binding a variable can cause
blocked goals to become unblocked, and
backtracking can cause currently unblocked goals to
become blocked again.  Moreover, if the current query is
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">?- <var>G1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gj-1</var>, <var>Gj</var>, <var>Gj+1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gn</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>where <var>Gj</var> is the first unblocked goal, and matching
<var>Gj</var> against a clause head causes several blocked
goals in <var>G1</var>, &hellip;, <var>Gj-1</var> to become unblocked,
then these goals may become reordered.
</p>
<a name="index-floundering"></a>
<p>Another consequence is that a query may be derived consisting
entirely of blocked goals.  Such a query is said to
have <em>floundered</em>.  The top level checks for this condition.  If
detected, then the outstanding blocked subgoals are printed on the
standard error stream along with the answer substitution, to
notify the user that the answer (s)he has got is really a speculative
one, since it is only valid if the blocked goals can be
satisfied.
</p>

<p>A goal is blocked if certain arguments are
uninstantiated and its predicate definition is annotated
with a matching block declaration (see <a href="Block-Declarations.html#Block-Declarations">Block Declarations</a>).  Goals of certain built-in predicates may
also be blocked if their arguments are not sufficiently
instantiated.
</p>
<p>When this mechanism is used, the control structure resembles that of
coroutines, suspending and resuming different threads of control.  When
a computation has left blocked goals behind, the situation
is analogous to spawning a new suspended thread.
</p>
<p>When a blocked goal becomes unblocked, the situation is analogous to
temporarily suspending the current thread and resuming the thread to
which the blocked goal belongs. Please note that a stretch of
unifications is treated as atomic with respect to unblocking
goals. Also, if such a stretch is followed by an explicit failure
(<code>fail/0</code>, <code>false/0</code>), any unblocked goal is not run.
